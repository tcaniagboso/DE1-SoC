# DE1-SoC
This C++ program uses Object-Oriented Programming (OOP) concepts to control the seven-segment displays on a DE1-SoC board. The program is implemented using classes and objects that are divided into header and source files. The classes are designed to control the seven-segment display by writing to specific or all segments, turning off specific or all segments, and writing numbers to the display. The implementation consists of a SevenSegment class that controls the display and a DE1SoCfpga class that manages the DE1-SoC board's input and output ports. The SevenSegment class defines methods to write to a specific segment, write to all segments, clear a specific segment, and clear all segments. The DE1SoCfpga class defines methods to read and write data to the board's input and output ports. The program's functionality is assessed by writing different numbers to the display, turning on and off specific segments, and turning off all segmentis program successfully controls the seven-segment display and performs the intended tasks. Overall, this C++ program demonstrates the importance of OOP in embedded systems programming and the use of header and source files to organize code and improve code readability and maintainability.
